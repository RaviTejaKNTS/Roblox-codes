        <h2>Why We Built {SITE_NAME}</h2>
        <p>
          Roblox developers release codes at unpredictable times across Discord, social feeds, and livestreams. We created
          {" "}
          {SITE_NAME} to surface every legitimate drop in one reliable hub, complete with reward descriptions and
          redemption instructions.
